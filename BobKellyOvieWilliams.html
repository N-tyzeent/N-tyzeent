            <p>Bob kelly Ovie Williams ventured into entertainment early, 
                learned the ropes faster than most and launched into the deep fearlessly, knocking down tough doors, 
                doggedly blistering his way to success and fame.</p>
            <p>The Isoko-born young CEO & Managing Director of N-Tyze Entertainment was born in Ajegunle, 
                a pulsating hub known for producing some of Africa’s greatest entertainers and raised in Oleh (in the heart of the Niger Delta).
                 Bob Kelly knew early where he wanted to be: in the forefront of entertainment.</p>
            <p>Impactful stints with notable entertainment icons such as Gordons, Sunday Are (of List Ent. & Mo’ Hits) and Elvina Ibru helped to hone 
               his skills and prepare him fully. And when he was ready to go solo, he needed to further prodding.</p>
            <p>In 2013, while handling a Gordons Live In Asaba event, Bob Kelly met the super-talented singer, Humblesmith. 
                After a series of disinterest due to previous disappointments from other musicians, Bob Kelly finally gave the aspiring 
                musician audience, and he was blown away.</p>

                </div>
            <p>Not one to shy away from hard work, Bob Kelly rolled up his sleeves and began to push the artiste
               with everything he could muster.</p>
            <p>Gradually, the efforts began to yield fruits and today, N-Tyze Entertainment is synonymous with Humblesmith, 
                and they believe they are yet to scratch the surface.</p>
            <p>He believes in giving maximum attention and efforts to an artiste - something he has been doing doggedly 
               for Humblesmith for more than 6 years now. Being a perfectionists has its gains. Sometime in the near future, 
               Bob Kelly would open the doors for other artistes at N-Tyze Entertainment and still accord them the same fervour 
               which landed Humblesmith a top spot in the entertainment industry.</p>
            <p>Bob Kelly was a team member of the hugely successful West African Idols show in 2007. He toured
               various cities (Calabar, Abuja and Lagos) with the contestants (Timi Dakolo, Omawumi and more), D’Banj and Tuface Idibia.
                He was also Executive Assistant to the multi-talented Elvina Ibru between 2007 and 2008.</p>
            <p>In 2008, he was co-founder of Wake Entertainment until he broke away to start his
                dream outfit, N-Tyze Entertainment Limited.</p>

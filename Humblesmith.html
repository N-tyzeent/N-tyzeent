            <p>Humblesmith a.k.a The African Singercologist is a proud singer/songwriter and performer.</p>
            <p>He is proud of his art. He basks in the joy it brings to his growing list of listeners.
               He is also proud of the sweat that has gone into reaching this milestone.</p>
            <p>Incidentally, he knows that everything that came before (the toil and endeavour) will amount to squat if he fails 
               to kick into a higher gear and embellish his art. Most of all, he is proud of his humble beginnings.</p>
            <p>Born on the 14th of May, 1991 in Abakaliki (Ebony State, Nigeria), Ekene Ijemba (Ijemba Ekenedirichukwu Humblesmith)
                is the fifth of eight children of a stationery-dealer father and a teacher mother.</p><br>
            <div>

            </div><br>
            <p>At the very tender age of 6, Ekene discovered his penchant for entertainment. He led a group of
               his mates to perform at various social and church events. They were known then as American
               Boys (after the then-popular song they always used for their dance act).</p>
            <p>Growing up was tough, Ekene recalled. His elder siblings had to put in a lot of efforts through
               street-hawking to augment the meagre incomes of their parents.</p>
            <p>He had hardly shed his milk-teeth when he joined them with his own tray of snacks. Thus, for
               many, he is known as the &#39;moi-moi seller&#39;.</p>
            <p>Ekene&#39;s performances continued to attract attention. On several occasions, while on a hawking
               mission, he would hide his snacks and sneak into shows to perform. Clearly, nothing was going
               to stand in his way!</p>
            <p>Many years later, as a teenager, he went to Asaba, a town that was fast becoming synonymous
               with Nollywood. Ekene longed for the limelight to showcase his many talents. He was featured
               in some minor roles in a handful of movies, but the momentum was soon lost and he returned to Abakaliki.</p>
            <p>On his return to the laid-back town, he realised that he was completely cut off from
               entertainment opportunities. Abakaliki was better known for its huge rice mill. So, back to Asaba
               he went. This time, he was more determined to succeed.</p>
            <div>
                <img src="./10.jpg" alt="Humbelsmith" width="500px">
                <p><strong>Humbelsmith</strong></p>
            </div><br>
            <p>He combed the town for shows and scouted for movie roles with fervour. At a show, he
               approached the promoter with his demo cd and even begged to perform. After a long delay, the
               DJ gave him a two-minute spot. Ekene seized his 120 seconds and gave a performance of his life.</p>
            <p>He dazzled the audience with his music and vibrant stage performance. The show promoter
               was amazed and took note. So did some others, who applauded the electric stage presence he exhibited.</p>
            <p>Unknown to them, Ekene was following in the footsteps of his idol, Bright Chimezie, who lit up
               events across Nigeria and beyond with his powerful lyrics and energetic dance-steps.</p>
            <p>It wasn&#39;t long before the young man was snapped up by D G Records. Finally, Humblesmith
               was seeing his dream play out.</p>
            <p>In 2013, at the Gordon&#39;s Live In Asaba show, Humblesmith met Bob Kelly Ovie Williams, the
               CEO of N-tyze Entertainment Limited, who was handling the event, and that meeting turned out
               to be fortuitous for the wannabe singer. Bob Kelly was searching for young and passionate performers.</p>
            <p>Humbelsmith&#39;s vibrant dance steps and stage presence stole the show, making a huge
               impression on the young CEO. So, by the time they met again at the 2013 edition of
               Felabration, it was inevitable they would team up.</p>

            </div><br>
            <p>The next step is promotion and honing the young act to match and even surpass the best in the industry.</p>
            <p>N-tyze entertainment is poised to take the young act as far as possible, in a no-holds-barred
               campaign that promises to enrich the industry, add flavour to events and bring joy to listeners 
               of all age brackets and inclinations.</p>
            <p>For all his boisterousness on stage, the African Singercologist, as he also likes to be called, is
               focused on reaching the top and affecting lives, especially the young and aspiring musicians.</p>
            <p>The street hawker will no longer parade the streets of Abakaliki selling snacks. He now peddles
               an explosive, unique, groovy and truly African sound that will be heard all around the world. 
               And that is his niche, where he will be untouchable.</p>
